# Auto Install

This is a basic script I use to automatically install ArchLinux on virtual machines.

It will automatically format and prepare disk partitions in order to download a given list of software.

You can download and execute it by running the following command: 

```bash
curl -L vm.aze.sh | bash
```

As of today, this script is not finished yet and will receive updates in the upcoming future.
